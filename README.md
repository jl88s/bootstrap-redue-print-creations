### Bootstrap - Reworking on school final

I used my school final to learn bits and pieces of what Bootstrap has to offer. So far, I can see why developers use it. It's fast, easy, and responsive. My goal with this project is to furthur enhance my skills in different technologies (libraries and frameworks) to help speed development times.
